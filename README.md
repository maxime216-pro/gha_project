# GHA Project

## Introduction

The GHA Project API offers the possibility to collect some data about Github commit's comments filtered by keyword and a specific date.
This project is composed of 2 core functionnalities:
 1. a command with the CLI that allows us to get all data that matter to us from github events
 2. a public API to expose and filter some data

This project might interest you if you want to do some sentimental analitycs on commit's comment as instance

## Get started
You're just a few steps away from success 🚀

And you've got nothing to do for it except asking our API and do whatever you want with all served data 😍
